| Indo RoBERTa Emotion Classifier              | Indo RoBERTa Emotion Classifier is emotion classifier based on Indo-roberta model. It was trained on the trained on IndoNLU EmoT dataset. The model used was Indo-roberta and was transfer-learned to an emotion classifier model. Based from the IndoNLU bencmark, the model achieve an f1-macro of 72.05%, accuracy of 71.81%, precision of 72.47% and recall of 71.94%. | Steven Limcorn | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/StevenLimcorn/indonesian-roberta-base-emotion-classifier) |
| Indonesian RoBERTa Base Sentiment Classifier | Indonesian RoBERTa Base Sentiment Classifier is a sentiment-text-classification model based on the RoBERTa model. The model was originally the pre-trained Indonesian RoBERTa Base model, which is then fine-tuned on indonlu's SmSA dataset consisting of Indonesian comments and reviews.                                                                                | Wilson Wongso  | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/w11wo/indonesian-roberta-base-sentiment-classifier)       |

| HoASA                          | An aspect-based sentiment analysis dataset consisting of hotel reviews collected from the hotel aggregator platform, AiryRooms. The dataset covers ten different aspects of hotel quality. Similar to the CASA dataset, each review is labeled with a single sentiment label for each aspect. There are four possible sentiment classes for each sentiment label: positive, negative, neutral, and positive-negative. The positivenegative label is given to a review that contains multiple sentiments of the same aspect but for different objects (e.g., cleanliness of bed and toilet). | A. N. Azhar, M. L.
