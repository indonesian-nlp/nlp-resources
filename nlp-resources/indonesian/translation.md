| The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR)          | The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) is a milestone document in the history of human rights. Drafted by representatives with different legal and cultural backgrounds from all regions of the world, it set out, for the first time, fundamental human rights to be universally protected. The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly in Paris on 10 December 1948 during its 183rd plenary meeting. | UDHR & Joe Davison                                                                                                                                                                                                | [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/datasets/udhr)            |
